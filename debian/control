Description: GPU-accelerated video/image rendering primitives (development files)
 The library provides useful GPU-accelerated image processing primitives based
 on GLSL. It includes shader routines for decoding and transforming colors,
 tone mapping, dithering, and for various algorithms that sample from images,
 such as debanding and scaling.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
